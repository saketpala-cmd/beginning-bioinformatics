Step 1: User Input and Output

Programs often take input from users to make them interactive.

The input is stored in a variable and later displayed using output commands.

Example: asking someone’s name and greeting them.

Step 2: Mathematical Operations

Python has a built-in math library that provides many mathematical functions.

The hypot function computes the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, using the formula √(a² + b²).

This is an example of applying mathematical formulas in programming.

Step 3: Lists and Indexing

A list is a collection of items stored in a single variable.

Each item has an index (position), starting from 0.

You can access, replace, and add items in a list.

This shows how data can be grouped and manipulated.

Step 4: List Insertion

Lists allow inserting elements at specific positions.

When an item is inserted, other items shift to make space.

This demonstrates how lists are flexible and can grow or change in structure.

Step 5: List Slicing

Slicing means extracting a part of a list.

It is done by specifying a start and end index.

The end index is non-inclusive (it stops before that point).

Useful for selecting a portion of data.

Step 6: String Slicing

Strings behave like lists of characters.

You can extract substrings using the same slicing method as lists.

This is a way of working with text data by selecting parts of it.

Step 7: While Loop

A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

It is often used for repetitive tasks where the number of repetitions is not fixed in advance.

A counter variable is usually increased in each cycle to eventually stop the loop.
